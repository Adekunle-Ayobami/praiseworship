            By Praise | April 4, 2021
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Our Lord Jesus was born, lived, bruised, died on the cross and
            resurrected on the third day for you and me in order to save us from
            our sins and transgressions. The need to have an understanding of
            what the Glory of his Resurrection represents,I will define
            separately what we understand by Glory and Resurrection. What is
            Glory – It is one of those important words that is hard to really
            explain.However, we can understand it better if we look at it in
            three dimensions.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Concrete:</dt>
            <dd>
              Concrete: Is something real, something we can see, hear or
              touch.Abstract: It can also be abstract in the sense of not been
              able to touch.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Action:</dt>
            <dd>
              Action: It can also be used as an Action verb. “We are to Glory in
              God” which means that we are ex- pressing our admiration and
              praise for the excel- lency we see,
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
            What is Resurrection-It is the overcoming or surmounting of death.It
            is a reawakening or rebirth.The acceptance of oneself.Finally, we
            can also say it is the acceptance of the Holy Spirits interpretation
            of the world’s purpose. The Glory of his Resurrection is a beautiful
            thing we need to go out and educate individuals. We need people to
            have an understanding and a form of belonging with Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step is by teaching them about the life of Jesus and the
            Resurrection. And the only way we can succeed is by going out to
            evangelize.I remember reading a story of a man carrying the cross in
            the market place of England, a lady rushed up to him and asked “what
            happened to that Man” and he asked which Man “Oh you Know Jesus”
          </p>
          <p>
            then she explained there is Christmas and it’s about its birth, then
            there is Easter and he died on the cross and was resurrected I never
            heard what happened to him after that.The man had to give her the
            full message of Jesus and how he ascended and will come again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brothers and Sisters we have learnt, heard and watched stories about
            the life of Jesus Christ, but have we gone further to talk about the
            glory of his resurrection, just as the woman in the story had asked
            what happened after. I believe it is a clarion call to every
            individual to make it as a point of duty to go out and spread the
            news about the Glory of his resurrection and how we are benefiting
            from it which are: The Forgiveness of our sinsRedeemed and we can
            now walk in a new lifeOur Faith is well founded.Also to demonstrate
            to us that He has Power over Death.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Conclusion, it is safe for us to say that the Glory of his
            resurrection ushered in the Age of Grace and end- ed the Age of Law.
            His resurrection brought about the reawakening of peoples heart. He
            simply demonstrates this by showing us His heart and his work has
            not left mankind.His emphasis to us is that we are not alone and
            need not fear, we can lean on God and if we accept him as our sin
            offering we could no longer be bound to sin. Bible Study: 1Cor 15:1
            – 58 Brethren, the story of Our Lord Jesus did not end at the cross,
            Jesus Arose, Jesus Lives, Jesus is Alive. Amen

          <br /><br />
          <p>
            This bible verse reveals that the power of the church comes from the
            Holy Spirit and not from man (see Zech. 4.6). Man is endowed with a
            lot of skill, talent and capacity. But nothing of or in man can
            accomplish or replace the work of the Holy Spirit in God’s work.
            Ordinary people were able to do extraordinary things because the
            Spirit of God was at work in their lives. The ministry of the Holy
            Spirit is not a luxury; it is an absolute necessity.
          </p>
          <p>
            God’s people in the bible, experienced repeated fillings of the
            Spirit as they needed His presence in their lives to face new
            opportunities and obstacles (Acts 2.4; 4.8, 31; 9.17; 13.9).
          </p>
          <p>
            The word ‘Witness’ (Acts 1:vs 8)is used many times in the book of
            Acts. A witness is somebody who can give a firsthand account of
            something seen, heard, or experienced; for example, a witness to an
            accident. A witness tells what he has seen and heard (Acts 4:19-20).
          </p>

          <p>
            When on a witness stand in court, the judge is not interested in
            one’s ideas or opinions; he only wants to hear what you have seen or
            know. One is either a witness or not a witness. A witness will have
            a story different from others
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Christian baptized in the Holy Spirit, we should have stories
            of what we have seen and experienced. Particularly in our private
            lives. There should be testimonies of His guidance, presence,
            teaching, direction, revelation, healing, bringing things to our
            remembrance,
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have ever drunk a freshly opened Coca Cola drink, you will
            notice that there is a marked difference between it and one opened
            days ago, which has gone flat. This in a sense is the difference
            between a Witness and a Christian who is not baptised in the Holy
            Spirit. It is possible to have a vibrant ‘effervescent like
            relationship with the Holy Spirit. Remember He is a gift to be
            received. (Acts.1.4). You cannot earn Him by fasting and prayer
            (though it helps). You have to wait patiently (not impatiently)-The
            disciples waited for 50 days – almost 2 months (Acts.2.1)
          </p>
          <p>
            One can pray and ask God for the Holy Spir-it, trusting His loving
            kindness and mercy to be poured on us as individuals and as a Church
            Family Once He comes, there will be a difference. And He will come
            because the Father does not lie. (Acts.1.4, Matt.7.7-8)
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking again at Acts 1.8, it gives, a general outline of the Book
            of Acts as it describes the geographical spread of the Gospel: from
            Jerusalem (Acts 1-7) to Judea and Samaria (Acts 8-9), and then to
            the Gentiles and to the ends of the earth (Acts 10-28). This proves
            that once He comes, our witness will start at home first
            (Jerusalem), before spreading to the church and places of work
            (Judea & Samaria). After all, there is a proverb that says “Charity
            begins at home” .
          </p>
          <p>
            It stands to reason that the outflow of the Ho-ly Spirit will first
            be seen at home amongst our family members, friends and work
            colleagues. Is that your testimony? If not, why not ask for the
            mercy of God to honour the cry of your heart, as you wait patiently
            for our God, who hears and answers prayer, to fill you afresh with
            His Promised Holy Spir

          <br /><br />

          <p>
            5 And He said to them, “Which of you shall have a friend, and go to
            him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves;
          </p>
          <p>
            6 for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey, and I have
            nothing to set before him’;
          </p>
          <p>
            7 and he will answer from within and say, ‘Do not trouble me; the
            door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise
            and give to you’?
          </p>

          <p>
            8 I say to you, though he will not rise and give to him because he
            is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give
            him as many as he needs.

              >The first friend</span
            >
            is on the journey of life and at the midnight hour of his life. He
            was tired, hungry, helpless, stranded, and fearful – like we
            sometimes find ourselves. We also noted the time of the day –
            MIDNIGHT – dark time – that comes to everyone at some time or the
            other – on the journey of life. Be encouraged by the fact that
            whatever you are facing on your journey of life, and at the midnight
            hour of your life is not peculiar to you– others are facing stuff
            too.

            </span>
            No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but
            God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what
            you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of
            escape, that you may be able to bear it. God will make a way of
            escape for you in Jesus name. We also noted that this needy man knew
            a friend’s house was nearby and came for help. May God grant us
            friends that we can go to and share our issues of life with. This
            brings us to the second friend in the story

            Another way thing to note about the middle friend is that he has a
            correct relationship with the Bigger Friend.
          </h6>
          <p>
            The middle friend though did not have the 3 loaves, but he has the
            Friend who has all things. He knows another Friend who can help –
            that he could turn to at midnight. The Bigger Friend could identify
            with him as a friend. Like Abraham Isaiah 41:8 & Gen18:17. The
            testimonial of Abraham before God – made him God’s friend. You need
            to have a close friendship with the one that has the cattle upon a
            thousand hills – Psm 50:10-11. God wants such a relationship with
            you. He wants to help you, bless you, share all He has with you, but
            are you His friend? Do you fulfil the criteria that will grant you
            access to Jesus, the Bigger Friend? Do you obey Him or do you rob
            Him? Mal 3:8 will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me- In tithes &
            Offering —-

            Repent of every form of disobedience, especially in tithing and
            giving quality offerings to God.

          <h6>Where Are You? Spiritual Awakening</h6>

          <p style="color: black">Gen 3: 8-9</p>

          <br /><br />

          <p>
            8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in
            the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
            presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
          </p>
          <p>
            9 Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            This personal and direct question is the first one recorded that God
            ever asked of man, and it is the question He puts to individual men
            and women today. God knew exactly where they were and what they were
            doing/had done because God is both omniscient and omnipresent
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              God was not searching for Adam, He already knew where he was.
            </li>
            <li>
              God also knew what Adam had done and knows the future result of
              Adam’s actions.
            </li>
            <li>
              God asks us the same question He asked Adam,<span
                style="color: black; font-weight: bold"
                >Where are you?</span
              >
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p></p>
          <h6>This question means ‘How do you stand before God</h6>
          <h6>What is your spiritual condition?’</h6>
          <h6>
            The fact that it is God Himself who asks the question makes it
            vitally important that we face up to it, and answer it honestly.
          </h6>
          <br />
          <h5>The God the Creator asks, “Where are you?”</h5>
          <p>
            It means, are you standing and living as the old creation (Adam) or
            the new (Christ). Adam is the head of the old creation, Jesus is the
            head of the new creation. So “Where are you?” in the light of
            2Cor5:17 “in Adam” or “in Christ”?”
          </p>

            God against whom they have sinned asks, “Where are you?” In terms of
            way of life. Sin & morality

          <p>
            “Where are you?”- you are either saved or lost, because there is no

            God from whom they were hiding asks, “Where are you?”
          </h6>
          <p>
            Genesis 3:7-10 tells us of the efforts that Adam and Eve made to
            hide from God. Of course, no-one can hide from Him.
          </p>
          <h6>Please read Psalm 139:1-12</h6>
          <p>
            Proverbs 15:3 The eyes of the Lord are in every place, Keeping watch
            on the evil and the good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jeremiah 23:24 Can anyone hide himself in secret places, So I shall
            not see him?” says the Lord; “Do I not fill heaven and earth?” says
            the Lord
          </p>
          <p>
            All over the world people are trying to hide from God – to hide
            behind excuses for not loving Him and for not serving Him; Adam &
            Eve were behind some tree, but no tree, no excuse, nothing, can hide
            us from the all-seeing eye of God. Hebrews 4:13 And there is no
            creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to
            the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.
          </p>
          <h6>God to whom you must give account asks, “Where are you?”</h6>
          <p>
            Are you dressed in fig leaves or garments of skin?
            <br />
            Compare Genesis 3:21with Genesis 3:7.
            <br />
            The fig leaves which Adam and Eve sewed together speak of our own
            righteousness which is never acceptable before God (Isaiah 64:6).
            <br />
            but the garments of skin tell us that an animal had been killed, the
            blood had been shed, God Himself had made provision for His children
            to be clothed. So are you dressed in fig leaves, trusting in your
            own merit for acceptance before God, or are you dressed in garments
            of skin, which speak of God’’s gracious provision and righteousness
            provided in the gift of His Son? “Where are you?”
          </p>
          <h6>God who loves and seeks you asks, “Where are you?”</h6>
          <p>
            Listen for the tenderness, the compassion and the concern in this
            question that God asks of His children. Gen 3:9
            <br />
            In this three-word question there is a DEEP proof of God’s love.

            <br />
            God is watching you every moment of every day. God is observing you
            every moment of every day. God is interacting in your life every
            moment of every day. God knows the choices we make, even before we
            make them. God knows the motivation of our choices, even if we try
            to deceive ourselves. God knows the outcome of our choices. God also
            knows the future impact of our choices.
            <br />
            So, when the doors of the church are open, Where are you?
            <br />
            So, when your Bible sits closed on the table, Where are you?
            <br />
            When seats go unfilled at prayer meeting, Where are you?

          <h6>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SEEKING GOD: The example of David</h6>

          <p style="color: black">Gen 3: 8-9</p>

          <br /><br />

          <p>
            A characteristic feature of David’s biography is that he frequently
            sought the Lord’s counsel and direction. This feature is not seen in
            any other biography in the Old or New Testament. Whenever David
            faced a trial, especially with his enemies, he always asked to know
            God’s will. And each time he inquired, the Lord graciously gave him
            a clear and definite answer. Since all the Bible stories “were
            written for our learning”
            <span style="color: #045fca; font-weight: bold"
              >(Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11)</span
            >
            , they are full of instruction. In this conclusion to our series on
            David, a man after God’s own heart, we’ll look at nine times when he
            inquired of the Lord. They teach us that we always gain by seeking
            His counsel and guidance.
          </p>
          <h6>David’s 1st Request/Inquiry – 1 Samuel 23:1-3</h6>
          <p>
            “Then they told David, ‘Look, the Philistines are fighting against
            Keilah, and they are robbing the threshing floors.’” The Philistines
            had besieged Keilah, a fortified city within Judah’s borders
            <span style="color: darkslategray; font-weight: bold"
              >(Josh. 15:21, 44). “Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying,
              ‘Shall I go and attack these Philistines?’”</span
            >
            As anointed king, David considered himself Israel’s protector. The
            apostate King Saul had neglected the public safety, but David loved
            his country and desired to free it from its enemies. Yet he would
            not act without first seeking the Lord’s counsel. Though he was busy
            hiding from Saul, he thought of Keilah’s welfare.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="color: darkslategray; font-weight: bold"
              >“And the LORD said to David, ‘Go and attack the Philistines, and
              save Keilah.’”</span
            >
            The Lord responded immediately to David’s inquiry, and promised that
            David would save Keilah. But David’s 600 men said to him, “We are
            afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against
            the armies of the Philistines?” This presented a real problem to
            David: If his men were unwilling to follow him, how could he save
            the besieged city? His men were afraid of being caught between the
            Philistines and Saul’s army. Unlike David their eyes were not on
            God, but on their difficult circumstances
          </p>
          <h6>David’s 2nd Request/Inquiry – 1 Samuel 23:4-5</h6>

          <p>
            <span style="color: darkslategray; font-weight: bold">
              “Then David inquired of the LORD once again.”</span
            >
            David was not paralyzed by the fear of his men. He knew that God,
            who had said fight the Philistines and save Keilah, could easily
            make his men willing to follow him. David did not rebuke his
            warriors, but he turned once more to Jehovah.
            <span style="color: darkslategray; font-weight: bold"
              >“And the LORD answered and said, ‘Arise, go down to Keilah. For I
              will deliver the Philistines into your hand.’”</span

            The Lord did not ignore David’s second inquiry. He not only
            responded to David’s request, but gave an answer which was even more
            explicit than the first. Motivated by God’s divine promise, David
            and his followers conquered the Philistines, saved Keilah and took
            their cattle for much-needed food.
          </p>

          <h6>David’s 3rd Request/Inquiry – 1 Samuel 23:10-11</h6>
          <p>
            “Then David said, ‘O LORD God of Israel, Your servant has certainly
            heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my
            sake. Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul
            come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I pray,
            tell your servant.’ And the LORD said, ‘He will come down.’” Once
            more David cast all his care on God. Observe his words: He is more
            concerned for the welfare of others than for preserving his own
            life. Observe also that David addressed God twice by the title “LORD
            God of Israel,” which was God’s covenant title. It is a blessing to
            recognize our covenant relationship to God; it is always an
            effectual plea to make before the throne of grace. The Lord
            graciously answered him saying, “He (Saul) will come down.”
          </p>

          <h6>David’s 4th Request/Inquiry – 1 Samuel 23:12-14</h6>
          <p>
            “Then David said, ‘Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into
            the hand of Saul?’ And the LORD said, ‘They will deliver you.’”
            David had good reason to conclude that after delivering Keilah from
            the Philistines, its citizens would be on his side. But he did not
            put any confidence in their loyalty. So he sought further counsel
            from the Lord. This should speak to our hearts: We should never
            depend on others, but should depend only on the Lord for our
            guidance and protection. Once more the Lord responded immediately to
            David’s inquiry saying, “They will deliver you.” This must have
            saddened David, as ingratitude wounds deeply. God answered according
            to His knowledge of man’s heart.
            <br /><br />
            “So David and his men … departed from Keilah and went wherever they
            could go. Then Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah; so
            he halted the expedition. And David stayed in strongholds … in the
            mountains in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but
            God did not deliver him into his hand.” This too is good to see:
            David was willing to endure further hardship rather than endanger
            the inhabitants of Keilah. They went “wherever they could go” and
            God continued to protect David.
          </p>

          <h6 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold">
            David’s 5th Request/Inquiry – 1 Samuel 30:8-9
          </h6>
          <p>
            “So David inquired of the LORD, saying, ‘Shall I pursue this troop?
            Shall I overtake them?’ And He answered him, ‘Pursue, for you shall
            surely overtake them and without fail recover all.’” The Amalekites
            had invaded Philistine country and destroyed Ziklag. They also took
            the women and the children captive. When David and his 600 men
            returned to Ziklag – the city which had become their home –
            expecting to be reunited to their families, they found the city
            burned and their loved ones missing. After being reassured by the
            Lord that he would overtake the enemy, David attacked them and
            recovered all that the Amalekites carried off, including his two
            wives. The Lord graciously answered David regardless of how many
            times he inquired. His response to David came without delay, and He
            even told more than David had asked – he would “recover all.” In a
            moment the black cloud of sorrow was replaced by joy.
            <br /><br />
            Everything took place exactly as God had said. “So David went, he
            and the 600 men who were with him.” The force of this statement can
            only be appreciated by comparing it to an earlier one: “Now David
            was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him” (1 Sam.
            30:6). What a change! The anger of his men was stilled; they were
            again ready to follow their leader. David sought God’s guidance and
            received an assuring response.
          </p>
          <h6>David’s 6th Request/Inquiry – 2 Samuel 2:1-2</h6>
          <p>
            “It happened after this that David inquired of the LORD, saying,
            ‘Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah?’ And the LORD said to
            him, ‘Go up.’ David said, ‘Where shall I go up?’ And He said, ‘To
            Hebron’” (2 Sam. 2:1). This inquiry took place after the Philistines
            killed Saul and Jonathan. David would not take one step toward
            claiming his rights without consulting the Lord. With all his
            faults, he was in submission to the Lord, and in complete dependence
            on Him. God’s answer came at once: “Go up … to Hebron.” There he was
            anointed king.
            <br /><br />
            As with all his previous inquiries, the Lord promptly answered and
            graciously guided His servant. This is recorded for our
            encouragement. The Lord never tires of our asking. The more we seek
            His counsel, the more He is honoured and pleased. His command to us
            is, “In everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
            let your requests be made known unto God” (Phil. 4:6). God’s ready
            response to David’s inquiry is a sign of His willingness to hear us.
            <br /><br />
            The happy sequel to this inquiry is recorded for us: “So David went
            up there, and his two wives also … And David brought up the men who
            were with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the
            cities of Hebron. Then the men of Judah came, and there they
            anointed David king.” Those who had been David’s companions in
            tribulation were not forgotten now that he was king. David had been
            privately anointed as Saul’s successor (1 Sam. 16:12-13). Now the
            princes of the tribe of Judah publicly owned him as their king.
          </p>
          <h6>David’s 7th Request/Inquiry – 2 Samuel 5:17-21</h6>
          <p>
            “So David inquired of the LORD, saying, ‘Shall I go up against the
            Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?’ And the LORD said
            to David, ‘Go up, for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into
            your hand.’” The previous two verses read: “Now when the Philistines
            heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the
            Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of it and
            went down to the stronghold. The Philistines also went and deployed
            themselves in the Valley of Rephaim.” The fact that David had
            ascended to the throne of Israel did not deter his enemies, but made
            them jealous to attack him.
            <br /><br />
            Again this should speak to our hearts: The attack of the Philistines
            right after David’s coronation should warn us against finding
            security in prosperity. Opposition came with great force, as
            evidenced by the words “all the Philistines.” Little did they
            realise that they were rushing to their own destruction. They
            underestimated God’s power and were unaware that He was for David.
            David’s response to the Philistines was that instead of accepting
            their challenge and immediately engaging them in battle, he turned
            to the Lord.
            <br /><br />
            And the Lord immediately responded, and assured David of a victory:
            “I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.” How
            encouraging for us! We too are called to “fight the good fight of
            faith” (1 Tim. 6:12). God has promised that He will “bruise Satan
            under your feet shortly” (Rom. 16:20). Such a promise ought to
            encourage us for the conflict.
            <br /><br />
            “So David went to Baal Perazim, and David defeated the enemy … and
            he said ‘The LORD has broken through my enemies before me’” (2 Sam.
            5:20). God made good on His word, kept His promise, and gave David
            the victory. And David gave the Lord all the glory.
          </p>
          <h6>David’s 8th Request/Inquiry – 2 Samuel 5:22-25</h6>
          <p>
            “Then the Philistines went up once again and deployed themselves in
            the Valley of Rephaim. Therefore David inquired of the LORD, and He
            said, ‘You shall not go up: circle around behind them and come upon
            them in front of the mulberry trees. And it shall be, when you hear
            the sound of the mulberry trees, then you shall advance quickly. For
            then the LORD will go out before you to strike the camp of the
            Philistines.’” The Philistines’ return did not discourage David, but
            summoned him to renewed waiting upon God and seeking fresh strength
            from Him. Again David sought divine guidance even though he had been
            successful in the first battle. He realized that each victory
            depended upon the Lord.
            <br /><br />
            The circumstances were the same. David could have attacked the enemy
            just as he did before. Yet God’s answer now was the opposite of the
            previous one. Before it was “Go up.” But this time God said, “You
            shall not go up.” Everything seemed identical to human eyes, but
            God’s will must be sought each time, or victory is not insured. This
            was a real test of obedience, and David did not argue. Instead he
            waited upon the Lord and he was the gainer: “For then the LORD will
            go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines. And David
            did so, as the LORD commanded him; and he drove back the Philistines
            from Geba as far as Gezer.” David’s obedience was rewarded. God kept
            His promise and smote the enemy. What encouragement for us!
          </p>

          <h6>David’s 9th Request/Inquiry – 2 Samuel 21:1</h6>
          <p>
            “Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years … and
            David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, ‘It is because of
            Saul and his blood- thirsty house, because he killed the
            Gibeonites’” (2 Sam. 21:1). In Genesis 12:5-10, we read that soon
            after Abraham arrived in Canaan, a famine arose in the land. Instead
            of consulting God and trusting Him to meet his needs, he turned for
            help to Egypt, a symbol of the world. By contrast, David conducted
            himself differently. He inquired of the Lord to make sure that the
            famine was not a divine punishment for some wrong he did. As with
            all other inquiries, the Lord immediately responded: “It is because
            of Saul and his bloodthirsty house.”
            <br /><br />
            The Lord did not turn a deaf ear to David’s inquiry. How many of us
            have been like David, smarting under the chastening hand of God, yet
            allowing a lengthy period of time, like three years, to pass before
            we inquire of the Lord as to its cause. God told David that Israel
            was suffering because of Saul. It is an unchanging principle of
            divine government that God deals with nations according to the
            conduct of their rulers. The Lord’s controversy with Israel at this
            time was not over some recent thing, but one which had been
            committed years before yet never corrected. God does not forget.
            Many afflictions, both of individuals and nations, are punishment
            for past sins.
          </p>
          <h6>Learning From David</h6>

          <p>
            David’s multiple inquiries of the Lord reveal that he was a man of
            prayer, who was always intent to know His will. This was the main
            reason why he was called a man after God’s own heart. God says, “I
            have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who
            will do all My will” (Acts 13: 22). And David did!
            <br /><br />
            May the Lord give us grace to emulate David’s example and to
            cultivate the habit of always inquiring of the Lord and waiting for
            His answer. The more we seek direction from God in prayer and the
            more we desire to know His will, the more He is honoured and the
            more we are blessed. May we cultivate David’s spirit more and more,
            for it is written, “In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall
            direct your paths” (Prov. 3:6).

          <h6>The Woman With an Awful Past and Suspicious Present</h6>

          <p style="color: black">John.4.1-18</p>

          <br /><br />

          <p>
            Have you failed before? Have you made decisions in the past you are
            ashamed of today? Have you done things you’d rather not be reminded
            about?
            <br /><br />
            As you start a new year, be encouraged to know that Jesus knows
            where you are, where you have been, and what you have been.
            <br /><br />
            In this story in John.4.1-18, we see Jesus ignoring the
            long-standing tensions between Jews and Samaritans that had
            developed over the years, and made a choice of going through Samaria
            on His way to Jerusalem. (John.4.4)
            <br /><br />
            This choice he made led to the salvation of an ‘ignored’ Samaritan
            woman and her people. (The choices we make have an impact of people)
            <br /><br />
            Jesus was tired, weary and thirsty from His journey. All 12 of His
            disciples had gone to the shops to buy food. (who sends 12 people to
            buy food for 13 people?) (John.4.8), but the Lord was preparing an
            environment conducive for meeting the needs of a certain Samaritan
            woman.
          </p>
          <h6>He needed to meet the woman alone.</h6>
          <p>
            She was a defeated woman, with little self-worth, isolated from her
            friends and neighbours by the wrong choices and decisions she had
            made.
            <br /><br />
            She had tried to be friends with the other women, but nobody wanted
            to be friends with a woman who was married five times, would you?
            (John.4.18)
            <br /><br />
            More worrying to the other women was that the man she was living
            with was not even her husband. (John.4.18). If only they knew who
            she really was, or what she was going through.
            <br /><br />
            Wherever you are in your journey in life Jesus is interested in you
            and your future.
            <br /><br />
            The women gossiped about her past and her present, but her creator
            and God was interested in her future
            <br /><br />

            When other women went to fetch water early in the morning, she went
            around 12 noon when all the women would have left the river.
            (John.4.6-7)
            <br /><br />
            She could handle 5 disastrous marriages, but could not deal with the
            whispers and gossips of women. They pointing of accusing fingers on
            account of both her past history and present marital status.
            <br /><br />
            Anyone who yields to the Lord Jesus has a bright future, regardless
            of their past.
            <br /><br />

            However, Jesus knew what she was going through. He also knew that
            deep down she didn’t want her life to be ‘skewered’ as it was. He
            took a long journey, went through Samaria, sent away His disciples
            and broke protocol to speak to her. Wherever you are today, whatever
            your situation, Jesus knows. He will climb the highest mountain just
            to be with you The love Jesus has for you, (yes you) is a reckless
            love because He knows what you have been through in the past and
            what you are going through presently.
            <br /><br />

            He was able to get the woman to open up to him. She admitted that
            she was a failure, and received what Jesus offered- salvation
            (John.4.15, 25-26) Immediately she left her business and went about
            telling people about Jesus In this year of Greater Things, are you
            ready yield to Jesus? Are you ready to serve the Lord? (John.4.28)
            <br /><br />

            If you are going through a bad patch at the moment, I want you to
            know that the Lord knows everything about you and is willing to meet
            you at the point of your need. Will you respond in faith? Will you
            turn to the Lord? Will you receive the love He is giving to you?
          </p>
          <h6>Are you born again?</h6>
          <p>
            Don’t be too busy for the one who will leave the 99, climb any
            mountain, cross any valley or swim any river just to get to you.
          </p>
          <h6>Why not turn to Him today?</h6>
